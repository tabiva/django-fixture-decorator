# django-fixture-decorator

django-fixture-decorator provides an easy-to-use decorator for Django test cases, enabling automatic fixture loading for individual test methods. This allows greater flexibility by loading fixtures on a per-test basis, rather than for the entire test case as with setUp and tearDown. Reduce boilerplate and streamline your test setup by handling fixture management directly within the test method itself.
